  - Oh, hey mane, what's good... Came to kick it?
  - ... Nah?
  - 'I mean...so what. Yeah, I get it, I look gross, but it could be worse... You
    ever seen those giant centipedes? Now THOSE things are freaky as hell... '
  - You probably got a few questions as to the whole "suddenly not human" thing but
    uhhh... truthfully, I just woke up like this one day. Yep.
  - Went to bed a drug mule, woke up a cockroach. Not a bad trade-off if I'm being
    real.
  - Anyhow, it's been a while since you last stopped by, have you heard the news?
  - There's a new drug in town, goes by the name of "Raid". 'Sposed to be some souped-up
    blend of insecticide and paint thinner. Sounds nasty, but supposedly it gets
    you real high.
  - I've hit it a few times. Didn't interest me back when I had opposable thumbs,
    but it's made my newfound roach guts feel all tingly inside. Quite the rush.
  - You gotten in on this yet? You should, I'm telling you mane, this is an uncornered
    piece of the market.
  - I dunno how you go about cooking it, but if I recall, shit started spreading
    fast when the Slavs moved in.
  - 'They could probably hook you up, tip you off maybe, think their apartments on
    the second floor. '
  - Dibs on your first batch.
