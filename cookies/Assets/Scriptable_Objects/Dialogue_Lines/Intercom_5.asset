  sentences:
  - You...you my friend are one sick fuck I tell ya...
  - The shit we got on tape right now...pure gold. Some of my best work in years
    even.
  - Which makes this next sequence kinda awkward. Art imitates life as they say,
    and well...
  - Did ya think I'd let ya just waltz in, shoot some snuff and dip? Back to the
    outside world?
  - We run a pretty tight ship here at Body Covnt. No snitches, no loose ends. We
    shoot underground, and damn if we aren't gonna stay underground.
  - You were an extra, a backup, and now that I've got what I needed, we're gonna
    whack ya.
  - It won't be for nothing though! You'll have a starring role in my newest upcoming
    project...
  - '"Blunt und Ehre: Vol 1" Y''know, for the skinheads! It''s an undiscovered market,
    those Aryan fucks love senseless violence!'
  - ... *ahem*
  - Tough tits, I know, you could've been huge under different circumstances.
  - But hey, that's show business baby!
