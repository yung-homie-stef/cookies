  sentences:
  - Ah, you've finally arrived! I'm relieved to know you received our message.
  - Allow me to introduce myself. I am Father Huxley, and this here congregation
    is our sacred covenant, "The Children of the Shine".
  - "Many eons ago, galactic cartographer and later-to-be prophet \u27D2\u27D2\u260C\u22AC\u235C\u260D,
    known to our human tongues as Samet, bestowed upon us a cosmic wisdom far beyond
    our greatest reach."
  - Xe spoke to us about an impending rapture, set to demolish all forms of life
    as we know it in the most biblical of proportions.
  - 'But there was hope. Samet spoke of a celestial vessel known to circle the stars
    every other millennia, with the purpose of rescuing those deemed "spiritually
    touched" to live on the utopian space craft Yost-VII. '
  - And yet, due to the secular ignorance of flesh and bone, Samet's message fell
    upon deaf ears and was lost for millennia.
  - That is, until a man by the name of Jedidiah B. Hutchins was shown the forbidden
    knowledge of Earth's ticking clock. Designated as a prophet by Samet himself,
    Hutchins founded the church in 1957.
  - Since its inception, The Children of the Shine have offered spiritual attunement
    and aligning to those who seek it, all in order to redeem our one way ticket
    to paradise upon the rapture.
  - Which leads us to you, yes. As it turns out, Samet's revelation has come sooner
    than any of us expected. Don't you feel it? In your vibrations? In your core?
  - The Earth is dying, and taking all who remain tethered to it. We want to give
    you a chance to shed your humanly shackles and live among the stars with the
    rest of us.
  - Interested? We know you would be. We must act quick though. It won't be long
    before this planet is but a memory, and there is still much left to do before
    we can induct you into our family.
  - 'Before we begin, a modest deposit is required before we can divulge our teachings.  '
  - "We accept cash, debit, or credit. Be seeing you. \u23C3\u22D4\u27D2\u22CF."
