  sentences:
  - In the name of the 9th Archon of Creation and the 17 corners of the galaxy, what
    brings you here today? Huxley told me you were seeking confession.
  - Wouldst thou like to live deliciously? This is simply another step in preparing
    you for a life among the cosmos.
  - First, confess your wrongdoings to me. Any and all that you can feel staining
    your very soul.
  - I see... do not fret brother, for it only comes naturally to break the divine
    law set forth by Samet.
  - He too knows this, and only asks that we wash our fleshy hands before him in
    asking for forgiveness
  - Lastly, as Huxley mentioned, you are in the process of abandoning your earthly
    shackles. Though your soul is much cleaner, I can sense you gripping to the remains
    of your humanly possessions.
  - Going forward, we must strip you of your flimsy holdings. If it serves no purpose
    upon Yost-VII, we have no need for it. It will only serve to hold us back and
    drive us away from Samet's light.
  - "With your transgressions absolved and your dead weight detahced, we have finished
    confessional. Report back to Huxley dear brother. Be seeing you.  \u23C3\u22D4\u27D2\u22CF."
