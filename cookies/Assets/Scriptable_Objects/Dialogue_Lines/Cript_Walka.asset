  sentences:
  - Ayyyy would you look who it is, what's good mane?
  - 'How''s business been? Hopefully the sweeps haven''t gotten to you yet, Swamp
    and I are always appreciative of your "community service". '
  - And me? Well, y'know, new album's been doin' good, just got off of our "Candypaint
    Man" tour and are crashing here in Darby for the time being.
  - Say, could you do me a solid now that you're here? The pad we got is real nice,
    but with no tour rider we've had no luck getting our hands on some weed.
  - If you got any, I'd really appreciate it. Still have the Cookies strain? Used
    to love smokin' up in your apartment when you'd get that new stash.
  - Anyhow, no rush, I'll be chillin' here. And don't worry, I always make sure to
    tip my deliverymen. Good to see you again homie!
