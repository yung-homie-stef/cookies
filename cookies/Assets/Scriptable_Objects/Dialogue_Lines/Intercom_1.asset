  sentences:
  - 'Hey, you came through, that''s what I like to see. '
  - Bet you're wondering what all this shit is. Well, looks like I never formally
    introduced myself.
  - 'Name''s Randy. Randy Letner. Founder and chief director of Body Couvnt Adult
    Entertainment. '
  - Yep, I was hot shit. Top of the world. Any porno, you name it, chances are I
    was involved. They called me the "Spielberg of Sexploitation".
  - Well, until the...incident. Turns out, when one of your talents OD's on "your"
    meth that "you" supplied her when she was supposedly under "your" supervision
    fresh outta rehab it's suddenly all your fault.
  - 'Can you believe that shit? It''s not like I was there shooting it into her veins.
    In that case at least I wouldn''t have missed. '
  - 'Family sicced their lawyers on me, got sued out the ass. Had to mortgage the
    studio, cut 90% of our staff. Went from a pad in The Hills to this shit... '
  - We were ruined, didn't have nearly enough cash left to fund future films, or
    pay our skeleton crew, so I looked for a way out.
  - Tried running a podcast, but that went nowhere, so I turned to the next best
    thing... Ever heard of snuff?
  - 'It''s the newest trend in underground film: Pure, unfiltered, cold-blooded murder
    broadcasted directly to you, the viewer!'
  - I was kinda skeptical at first, not gonna lie, but after flipping a few scripts
    we were seeing major profit, shit sells man!
  - And ever since, we've specialized in entertainment for the scum-sucking masses
    to get off to. Which brings me to you...
  - 'We''ve had some trouble lately finding individuals that have that XXX Factor,
    y''know? Anybody can get iced on camera, but few can actually get down and dirty... '
  - When I saw you, I witnessed the birth of a natural. Right then and there I knew
    you were the one, the one who would propel Body Covnt to international sleaze
    stardom.
  - You down? Well...here's the deal, for the time being, ya work for me now, so
    really...
  - There's no way out, ya might as well say "yes". Financial compensation and all
    that too of course. Who knows, this could be the start of a burgeoning career.
  - Our studio is behind that door. Get rid of all that you got on ya, no funny business.
    See ya soon.
