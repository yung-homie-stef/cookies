  sentences:
  - Samet extends his gratitude to you. The artillery you've supplied will allow
    us to defend ourselves against those phillistines.
  - You've given up your money, your possessions, and risked punishment from the
    long arm of the law. There's no doubt in my mind...
  - You are deeply committed to a life beyond this planet. I think it is time...
  - 'In the confessional booth you will find the conduit we use to communicate with
    the celestial few. '
  - The Children of the Shine grants you divine permission to travel amonst the stars
    and bear witness to the wonder of Samet's grace. Take it, consume it, and allow
    Samet to shatter your sheltered view of the universe's workings!
