  sentences:
  - 'Sanguinem bibimus, corpus edimus. Ad superficiem in canalibus exurget. '
  - Ho ho, good labour my drudge! With your sublime intervention, we have finally
    enacted the sacred Rite of Sacrifice!
  - For years we spent our miserable rodent lives within the confines of this building,
    starving away, or gassed to death if lucky.
  - All we needed was something...SOMEBODY...to do what our miniscule paws could
    not, and upon good fortune did we unearth.
  - A lowly fiend, with nothing else to do but obey the rodents his hazeous mind
    "conjured" with his vegetables. Someone depraved enough to set forth our macabre
    motion.
  - We required just the flesh of a sole rat queller, and that you granted us...and
    it only took a few free meals to fabricate your devotion.
  - Gather the fleas! The Profane Rat Coven of Salvador the Plagued lives to scurry
    another day!
  - 'Our plan commences at once! We will reclaim this planet for ourselves as it
    was in the Bubonic Age! Fly my carriers! Fly! '
  - Rats off to you you fine poison peddler!
