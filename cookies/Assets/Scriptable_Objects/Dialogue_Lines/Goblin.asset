  sentences:
  - Hey mane, itchin' for some of that Raid stuff too huh? Was told this was the
    spot.
  - 'Been camping out here for like 3 days now, and those svolachs won''t let me
    in. '
  - 'Said they only accept one form of currency: body parts...yeah, a literal pound
    of flesh. '
  - You think they'd elaborate with a weird ass request like that, but nope, radio
    silence. I just wanna get high dude...
  - Maybe it's a black market thing, collateral perhaps...maybe they use it to blackmail
    folks, you just KNOW they got enemies in high places...
  - I mean, I ain't gettin' involved in that, I'll just wait around for the next
    sicko who waltzes in with a lung and maybe go halfsies.
