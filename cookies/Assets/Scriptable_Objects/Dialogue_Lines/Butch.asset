  - Hey, it's Butch, where the fuck you been? I've been calling you for the past
    2 hours...
  - Your numbers for the month are shit, we're hemorrhaging money where Darby County
    is concerned and I struggle to see why I'm even keeping you on payroll.
  - Been getting a lotta mean looks from upstairs man, look you're a decent guy but
    the fact is if you can't move weight you're as good as useless here.
  - So, I thought I'd toss you a softball. Weed's clearly not selling, nor is whatever
    the hell you're getting into with the Russians or the meth heads.
  - 'So I lined up a nice and easy gig for you out in the boondocks. Y''know, the
    Dead Reeds. Buncha yokels there asked for somebody that could cook up DMT. '
  - Said they needed it for some typa procedure they got going on, the less we know
    the better if ya ask me, what's important is they're willing to fork over a shitton
    of cash if you do it.
  - You still remember how to cook dust right? Good. We'll get your ass down to the
    Reeds, you'll make their shit and it'll be one hell of a payday.
  - It'll make you look real good, so when alls said and done ya owe me. After this
    you'll be in the boss' good graces for a while.
  - 'When you''re ready head to the lobby, got a driver waiting outside to take you
    to the sticks. There''ll be a boat waiting at the docks. Good luck. '
  - Please. Don't fuck this up. *click*
