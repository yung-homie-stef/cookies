  sentences:
  - "Hey cabr\xF3n, glad you could make it. "
  - 'We was just finishing up our talk with pork chop over here. See, it appears
    somebody needed to be taught a lesson. '
  - 'Do you know what the cardinal sin of the 305 is? Being a fucking rat. We let
    these hogs in on the goods with only two simple requests: keep the heat off us,
    and do it discreetly.'
  - So, as you could guess, it's a bit of a problem when it turns out one of our
    own goes on blabbing to some street chavala about this n' that.
  - Luckily for us you're more shameless than the hogs, but had any prude caught
    wind nuestra familia would be done for, consecutive lifetimes in the hole for
    all of us.
  - 'Serious shit... I''m sure you can understand the need to keep Darby''s Finest
    in line. And yet, this mess ain''t done with yet. '
  - We're looking at a dead cop and two loose ends, those hip-hop chicos... Stage
    a shootout, tell them they were resisting arrest and things get hairy. Lead starts
    flying, folks bleeding out, open and shut.
  - I'll call my connect at the precinct once its been done and fill him in, he can
    fudge the paperwork for a few extra racks. That'll put us in the clear for at
    least a month or two.
  - "And you gringo? Stay outta our way. Keep this shit on the DL like I said, and
    tomorrow you'll wake up with a few kilos courtesy of the 305. \xA1Vete! "
