  sentences:
  - Pleasure doing business with you...the business of retribution that is!
  - You've done well, you've shown you're willing to part ways with the corrosive
    possession of material wealth.
  - I can see it now, a superflous celestial soul cluster in the making! Samet has
    great plans for you. We must go further though!
  - 'Your pockets are lighter, thus your soul is too, yet I can still feel the subsonscious
    weight dragging your very core down to the depths. '
  - Go, direct yourself to our confessional booth. Speak with one of our clergy members
    and detox your being of that which grounds you to this humanly prison.
  - I will be here when you return.
