    share clientele you can fuck right off.

    your Florida gringos got the message. Enh, what''s that? '

    found some bait for the net. '

    of the cops got you roped up in this, figured I owe him a bonus too. '
  - As for you, meet us downstairs, Room ___ . My compadres and I got some dead stock
