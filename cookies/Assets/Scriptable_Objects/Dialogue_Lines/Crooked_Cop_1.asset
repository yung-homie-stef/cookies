  sentences:
  - Stop. Right. There.
  - Distribution of marijuana. Possession of more than 20 grams. I take it it's not
    your first offense either.
  - 'You''re looking at at least 5 years in the hole right about now, so shut up
    and listen. '
  - Those pushers from down south, y'know, the 305 Sinnerz, we've got a deal of sorts
    with them. They get to traffick their coke throughout Darby, we get a slice of
    the pie.
  - 'Sounds easy enough, right? Well, where it gets tricky is that no matter which
    way you cut it, there''s a lotta crack here, too much. '
  - Obviously we gotta do our jobs, but we're not about to lock up our cash cow now
    are we? Besides, who knows what would happen if word got out.
  - So, every so often, we do a lil bit of improv and someone else takes the fall
    for it. Small time peddlers, hookers, activists, y'know. Darby's Finest gets
    the golden star from the Chief and our cholo pals get free enterprise.
  - And that's why I, and now you, are here. Once I got wind of those gangster rappers
    shacking up here I found myself an easy target.
  - 'And you''ll be our accomplice, unless of course you''d prefer bunking with the
    Aryans. All you gotta do is look the other way and deny any involvement with
    these thugs. '
  - We hit our quota, and you're free to hock your dope for the time being. Get on
    the Sinnerz good side and they may even let a small fish like you coexist.
  - 'Well, now that that''s cleared up I''m gonna prep the arrest. A simple weed
    charge will get the book thrown at ''em. Remember, hush hush. '
  - 'In the meantime, introduce yourselves to the Sinnerz, Room 312, let ''em know
    I got my next target lined up. Maybe they''ll reward you for your participation. '
