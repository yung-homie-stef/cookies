  sentences:
  - 'At last, the Royal Rat Primacy of Salvador XIV has been restored to its former
    glory. A thousand thanks is not nearly enough. '
  - And yet, I have but one last task to bestow upon you. Its execution decides the
    very fate of my people.
  - There is a demon who roams these passages, and has for many years now.
  - They call him "The Janitor", a wretched being that has razed generation upon
    generation of us rat-kin, for the hollow motive of "health code inspections".
  - Please, I beg of you, take the peace maker I have placed on your coffee table,
    and put an end to The Janitor's tyranny once and for all! Only then shall my
    kingdom prosper in peace.
  - The festivities will commence when you return. Go, and may Karni Mata watch over
    you!
