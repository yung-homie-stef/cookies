  sentences:
  - Hoo wee, that's that shit! Glad to see our acommodations were up to scratch.
  - Can already tell this gon' be the best ritual yet.
  - Yep, Butch was right, you ain't good lookin' but you sure is one dumb son of
    a bitch.
  - What'd he tell ya? Couple grand? Keeping your job? Heh, he said if dumb was dirt
    you'd cover a whole damn acre.
  - 'Can''t sell shit , your maths bad, and trouble rises to meet you wherever you
    step foot. You''re a full tick o'' liability ya hear? '
  - See Butch, your boss, is a good pal o' mine. And we don't let outsiders cause
    grief to our own like that...
  - 'Them yuppies on the outside ain''t go no respect for our Constitution, thinking
    they can alter our rights! '
  - We know our rights! Here though, this is our country son. God's Country. Way
    we see it this Earth is done for.
  - It's too late for y'all to repent. When I saw Butch having trouble, I offered
    to lend him a hand. Scum like you can go missing without a hitch.
  - No doubt about that, but if your body's found...whew. Out here though? The swamp
    tells no secrets.
  - We got a different way of getting God up to speed here. Tributes, if ya may,
    to show we're worth a damn come the rapture.
  - So, if it wasn't clear already, Butch had no reservations handing you over, and
    w're all the happier 'bout it . Time to get them knives sharpened.
  - 'Don''t view this as a layoff. '
  - 'Consider this a promotion. '
