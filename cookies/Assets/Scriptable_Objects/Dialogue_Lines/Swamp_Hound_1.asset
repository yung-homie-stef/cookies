  - 'Long time no see pusher king! It''s too bad you couldn''t catch a tour date,
    but we back now. '
  - Been fiending for a sample of your work since we left...got anything left in
    your supply?
  - Cript likes rolling up, but I prefer my baked goods y'know? If your oven ain't
    broke could you whip up a batch of COSMIC BROWNIES for me?
  - For real? You're the best mane! If you don't got any CBD I'm sure it won't be
    hard to buy in this building.
  - When it's done you know where to find me. Maybe we can kick back and shoot the
    shit if your schedules open.
  - Peace.
