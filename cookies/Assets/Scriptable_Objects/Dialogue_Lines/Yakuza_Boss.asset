  sentences:
  - So, you're the American Inaba told me about.
  - "I am \u014Ctomo Tawara, captain to the \u014Cmukade Family, and this here is
    our HQ."
  - "I see you've already familizarized yourself with the workplace, our humble credit
    counselling centre. Though, that's only the surface of \u014Cmukade's operations
    here. "
  - Real estate, construction, investments. Our tendrils run deep in this county.
  - 'Mind you, you didn''t come to hear my resume. '
  - It has been brought to my attention that you discovered one of our soldiers,
    Watari, dead in a vacant room within this complex.
  - 'No surprise really, kid had a bad habit of fucking with the Russian Mafia. I
    made it clear to him that sooner or later he''d be staring down the wrong end
    of a barrel. '
  - On the side, we tend to dabble in more lucrative things. Watari was head of our
    drug trafficiking negotiations, and felt threatened by the Soviet's share of
    the turf.
  - 'He made it known in a very...upfront way. But if what Inaba tells me is correct,
    this was not the work of the Russos. '
  - "Recently, our contract hitman, Ichi, defected from the \u014Cmukade, stating
    that the family's grasp on Darby County was weakening in a vain effort to adhere
    to an \"archaic code\"."
  - '"Honour killed the samurai", as he put it. Disgruntled, we let him go, on the
    condition that he sever his tongue as penance. '
  - 'He would walk away a free man, but the secrets of his work would stay with us.
    A fair deal I thought. '
  - Still, he stormed off enraged, cursing us as he left the building. It is now
    my opinion that Ichi is exacting his revenge on our family, perhaps in an effort
    to claim the trust of his new director.
  - I ask of you, please, help us track down Ichi. I will stay here and hold down
    the fort in case he comes for me. As for you...
  - Start by checking in with the Soviets on Floor 2. It's not much, but they're
    our only real link to this whole mess. See if they can shed some light on anything.
  - 'Find him, send him to me if you must. But I warn you, he may not give you the
    option. Succeed, and you shall be rewarded handsomely. Go with honour. '
