  sentences:
  - Yo mane, you just missed it! It was the sickest shit I've ever seen!
  - So there I am, squatting in the hallway like usual, smoking a cig, when this
    dude walks by and starts banging on the door like he pays the bills.
  - He tells them he's from one of them Korean factions and has some private matters
    to discuss. They let him in and immediately he starts kicking ass!
  - Whippin' out katanas, grabbing guns and lettin' it rain on 'em. Dude meant serious
    business. It was so badass!
  - And just like that, the guy dipped set. Don't know why he thought to spare me
    but I ain't complaining'. Those Korean gansters ain't nothin' to fuck with.
  - Word on the street is they're deep into sex trafficking rings. In fact, apparently
    they got a connect right in this very shithole!
  - 'Rumours say that kooky ass pastor here is in on it, got some "cargo" of his
    own that he ships overseas to them for a profit. '
  - Headin' a cult ain't cheap y'know?
  - 'But hey, that''s just what I''ve heard. Now, if you don''t mind, it''s about
    time I get high off my newfound supply. '
