  - So...whaddya want? Nobody pulls up with human organs for charity's sake.
  - We've got guns. DashCoin. Blackhats. Social media bots.
  - Raid?..... Hm, word's getting around enh? Yeah, we've got some of that. Cooked
    up a batch this morning.
  - 'This stuff''s nuts. You''ll be shitting your pants, seeing in 4D and talking
    to Christ before it''s all done and flushed out. '
  - You ain't making off with it that easy though. You come in here all giddy, but
    how do we know you're not narcs. You're lucky we didn't already check you for
    wires.
  - 'You really about it? Well, take it right here, right now, in front us. '
  - Oleg's got your sample at the bar. Try not to bug out when you're tweaking, do
